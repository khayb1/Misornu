            "body": "As Ghana gears up for the 2024 General Elections, the importance of election safety and security has become paramount. In line with its mission to foster a safety-first mindset and culture at the personal, institutional and community levels, Misornu Safety Centre, a non-governmental organization dedicated to security and safety, education and collaboration, organized a seminar for the staff of Accra City Hotel on Tuesday, 23rd November 2024. The event, led by the Center CEO, Mr David Senanu Eklu, a retired Deputy Commissioner of Police, focused on equipping participants with the knowledge and tools to ensure safety during, before, and after the elections. A Call to Vigilance and Proactivity Speaking at the seminar, Mr. Eklu emphasized the vital role of security during elections, not only for voters and election materials but also for the critical infrastructure that sustains communities. He stressed that safeguarding facilities such as banks, hotels, utilities, and markets is integral to the democratic process. “Security vulnerabilities, if left unaddressed, can pose significant risks to individuals, communities, and the nation as a whole,” he noted. “The police are your friends—do not hesitate to draw their attention to any suspicious occurrences. Their mandate is to protect you and safeguard the democracy of the day.” Key Measures for Election Safety Mr. Eklu shared practical strategies for ensuring safety during elections, highlighting the 3Ds and R approach: Deter: Encourage vigilance to discourage crime. Detect: Identify early warning signs of threats. Delay: Implement measures to frustrate or prevent attacks. Respond: React swiftly and appropriately to incidents. Participants were urged to adopt these measures by: Identifying threats and suspicious behaviour. Reporting incidents promptly to authorities. Following established security protocols at polling stations and surrounding areas. A Broader Perspective on Safety The seminar also explored the role of Election Security Task Forces at the national, regional, and district levels in coordinating efforts to ensure a peaceful electoral process. Mr. Eklu reinforced the idea that ensuring election safety is a collective responsibility. “Each person is responsible for ensuring peace and security in their community, as it is a concerted effort,” he remarked. Building Awareness and Resilience The participants, who left the seminar feeling informed and inspired, appreciated the comprehensive insights shared. They expressed eagerness to apply the lessons learned and looked forward to similar events in the future. Misornu Safety Centre continues to lead the charge in creating safer communities through its educational initiatives, fostering vigilance, and inspiring individuals to take active roles in ensuring security. As the nation prepares for a crucial electoral season, such initiatives serve as reminders of the power of collaboration in preserving peace and democracy. The Misornu Safety Center also organized a similar training for the staff of Fidelity Bank in the Southern and Northern sectors of the country on November 27th and 28th 2024 respectively.",
